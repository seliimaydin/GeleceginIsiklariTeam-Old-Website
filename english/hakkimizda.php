In line with the #MilliTechnologyMove, it is among our goals to provide benefits to our state and nation in certain technologies and issues, and to support us in reaching the level of other states in technical terms.

            <center><h4 class="title"><a href="">2018</a></h4></center>

 On November 3, 2018, we established a Technology Club at Işıkkent Anatolian Imam Hatip High School.
            <br> <br>
            We worked on robotics and coding, 3D printing and Arduino within our club. We renewed our club by gaining a certain amount of support from the Ministry of Youth and Sports with our robotic studies.
            <br><br>
            <center><h4 class="title"><a href="">2019</a></h4></center>

            While continuing our previous work in 2019, we started to develop ourselves by starting software studies under the leadership of our leader.
<br><br>
            <center><h4 class="title"><a href="">2020</a></h4></center>
            Our Technology Club has been renewed and turned into the Geleceğin Işıkları team!
            <br><br>
            Until 2020, we concentrated on our own work. In March of the same year, we participated in the Tübitak 2204-A Competition. We made a presentation to the jury in the Regional Final, but we could not reach the final.
            <br><br>
            Participated in the World's Biggest Technology Competition Teknofest held in Gaziantep in September as a finalist and made a presentation to the jury. We ranked 21st in Turkey in the Environment and Energy Technologies category.
<br><br>
            <center><h4 class="title"><a href="">2021</a></h4></center>

            In January 2021, we participated in the 1st National High School Patent and Utility Model Competition from the Patent section. The result has not yet been announced.
<br><br>
We've grown your team for bigger goals and achievements. Our leader has created a talented and effective staff by adding new friends to the team.
    <br><br>       

    In February, we increased our target to qualify for the finals with multiple projects at Teknofest.
<br><br>
           
As of March 2021, we accelerated our work on many ideas. We have applied for our eligible projects for Teknofest 2021.
            <br><br>
           
            We participated in the GYP Idea Marathon between 19-22 May. We passed all the stages successfully, but we could not reach the final. An initiative called LSN-VR has emerged!
             <br><br>
           We made it to the top 50 at the Imam Hatip Schools Successful Examples Exhibition in July!
            
            <br><br>
            We made it to the Teknofest final for the second time in a row! We are also at Teknofest 2021 Istanbul!
            <br><br>
            As of August, “Code Name: A.Y.İ.T.O.” We have been working on our project named “Code Name: BUZZ”, “Code Name: SU” and “Code Name: HL032” for 8 months. We continue on our way at full throttle with our resolution and determination.
